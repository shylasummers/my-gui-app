To get started with the app, call `npm install` at the root.
To run the app, call `node server.js` and `npm start` from the src folder. Note that these two calls must be done from two separate terminals. Once `npm start` is called, the app should open in a new tab. If it doesn't, visit http://localhost:3000/.
